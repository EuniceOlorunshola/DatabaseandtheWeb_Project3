# Project3

# Description about this project 
I did this project for my database and the web class as a graduate student 
It contains 4 parts

# Part I : JSON Schema for Schema files 

  Design a JSON Schema(ModelSchema.json) for database schema files such as StudentDBSchema.json.
  
# Part II : Python program to Generate JSON Schema for Instance Files

 Write a Python program (GenerateInstanceSchema.py) that takes as command line argument the name of a database schema file, such as StudentDBModel.json, and outputs to the terminal a JSON Schema file for the database instance files corresponding to the input ER schema. As before, the output schema should strictly enforce the object structures with no additional keys or no fewer keys.
  
# Part III :
